## 🚀 Features

### 🔒 Anonymous Wallet Analysis  
Connect using your blockchain wallet (Sui or EVM).  
No KYC. No personal information.  
AICashflow decodes on-chain transactions and contract interactions to build an accurate financial profile — while keeping users 100% anonymous.

### 🤖 AI Financial Assistant  
AICashflow includes an AI-powered assistant that:  
- Categorizes transactions automatically  
- Identifies spending patterns  
- Provides budgeting insights  
- Helps you plan a healthier financial future  
All based solely on transaction data.

### ⭐ Web3 Credit Score  
We generate a decentralized credit score derived from on-chain activity.  
This gives users a transparent, trustable, and privacy-safe financial reputation that can be shared with sellers, lenders, and future partners.

### 🎖️ Credit Score NFT  
Users can mint a non-transferable NFT containing their current score.  
This NFT becomes a *Web3 trust passport*, creating a permanent, evolving record of financial reliability.

### 📤 CSV Upload (Web2 → Web3 Bridge)  
Users can upload CSV files with transaction history.  
This allows AICashflow to analyze traditional finance data using the same privacy-first approach.
